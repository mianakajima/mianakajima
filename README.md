##  ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Mia

I graduated from UC Berkeley in 2018 with a double major in Statistics and Physics. I worked for three years afterwards as an Energy Analyst at TRC, where I worked on data analysis and energy simulations to improve the [2022 California Energy Code](https://www.energy.ca.gov/programs-and-topics/programs/building-energy-efficiency-standards/2022-building-energy-efficiency) and city reach codes. 
I love data analysis and believe in working to make the world more sustainable. I just finished a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/), where I have been indulging in the joy of learning and trying to increase my data science tool box.
